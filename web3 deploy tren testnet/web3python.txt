1.Install python
2.Install pip for python 3
3.Set python 3 as default to use web3 library. In ubuntu I use this method and it works fine
    Check python version on terminal: python --version
    Get root user privileges: sudo su
    Write down the root user password
    Execute this command:
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
4.To deploy web3 on testnet, I use metamask
    Creat an account on metamask. Metamask will provide private key and account address in your account.
    Change to Ropsten Testnet Network.
5.Get Ropsten ether to test. You must have Ropsten ether to send transaction. 
  https://faucet.ropsten.be/ or https://faucet.metamask.io/ will give you ether to test.
6.Run Deploy.py on terminal: python Deploy.py
    The output is the transaction hash and the contract address. Save this contract address. Now you can interact with your smart contract with this address
7.Run SendTransaction.py on terminal to add data and build transaction.
    The output is the transaction hash. You can check transaction status on this link: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/
8.Run ReadData.py on terminal to see the information you have added to the contract in step 7.
