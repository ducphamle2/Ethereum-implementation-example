ERC20 tokens are contracts that implement the ERC20 standard. Operations handled by these contracts include getting the total supply and balance of tokens, and the methods used to transfer them.

functions:
totalSupply() public view returns (uint256): return the total token allocated in this supply regardless of owner
balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint): return the token balance of owner
transfer(address receiver, uint numTokens) public returns (bool): transfer directly from the owner token to the receiver

When we transfer the token from the owner to the receiver through the third-party account, we use 3 functions:
approve(address delegate, uint numTokens) public returns (bool): send token from the owner to the delegate account
allowance(address owner, address delegate) public view returns (uint): return the number of token sent by the owner
transferFrom(address owner, address buyer, uint numTokens) public returns (bool): the receiver withdraw the token from the delegate account

Library SafeMath helps this contract guarantee that there is no overflow before executing
